- **Features**: Same functionality as Events page but with optimized rendering and data handling

#### 👤 **Events with Session** (Green Alert - User Experience)
- **Technical Focus**: Session management and user experience enhancement
- **What to Observe**: localStorage integration, personalization, recommendation algorithms
- **Key Learning**: State persistence, user behavior tracking, dynamic content
- **Features**: Bookmarking, viewing history, personalized recommendations, session restoration

#### 📋 **Attendance Demo** (Green Alert - State Management)
- **Technical Focus**: Real-time state management and event-driven architecture
- **What to Observe**: Component communication, state machines, event subscriptions
- **Key Learning**: Enterprise-level event management, workflow tracking, data aggregation
- **Features**: Event registration, check-in/check-out, attendance tracking, analytics

#### 🔐 **Session Demo** (Green Alert - Session Fundamentals)
- **Technical Focus**: Core session management patterns
- **What to Observe**: Authentication workflows, session duration tracking, data persistence
- **Key Learning**: User authentication, session lifecycle, browser storage integration
- **Features**: Manual login/logout, session monitoring, activity tracking

## 💡 How to Explore Effectively

### 1. **Start with the Baseline**
Begin with the **Events** page to understand the standard implementation, then compare with **Events Optimized** to see performance improvements.

### 2. **Experience the User Features**
Navigate to **Events with Session** to see how session management enhances user experience with bookmarks and recommendations.

### 3. **Try Interactive Features**
- **Session Demo**: Log in/out to see session tracking in action
- **Attendance Demo**: Register for events and try check-in/check-out workflows
- **Events with Session**: Bookmark events and observe personalized recommendations

### 4. **Compare Implementations**
- **Events vs Events Optimized**: Notice performance differences in data handling
- **Events vs Events with Session**: See how session features enhance basic functionality
- **Session Demo vs Events with Session**: Observe session patterns in isolation vs integration

### 5. **Read the Technical Summaries**
Each page's colored alert explains:
- The technical approach used
- Key technologies and patterns demonstrated
- How it compares to other pages
- What to focus on while exploring

## 🔧 Development Setup (Optional)
